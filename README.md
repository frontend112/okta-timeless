live master: https://distracted-jackson-d953cb.netlify.app/<br/>
To create this page I used css, react, gatsby, graphQL, netlifycms<br/>
This page allows add posts without go inside code<br/>
but need to login ofc:<br/>

https://distracted-jackson-d953cb.netlify.app/admin<br/>
localhost8000/admin does not working correctly<br/>
adding new pages works only from live server<br/>
